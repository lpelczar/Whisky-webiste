    <h3>What is Whisky(ey)?</h3>
    <p>Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Various grains
        (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn (maize), rye, and wheat.
        Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak.</p>
    <p>Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types.
        The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains,
        distillation, and aging in wooden barrels.</p>

    <h3>Production</h3>
    <h4>Distillation</h4>
    <img class="paragraph-img" src="assets/images/Glenfiddich_Distillery_stills.jpg">
    <p>A still for making whisky is usually made of copper, since it removes sulfur-based compounds from the alcohol
        that would make it unpleasant to drink. Modern stills are made of stainless steel with copper innards (piping,
        for example, will be lined with copper along with copper plate inlays along still walls). The simplest standard
        distillation apparatus is commonly known as a pot still, consisting of a single heated chamber and a vessel to
        collect purified alcohol. Column stills are frequently used in the production of grain whisky and are the most
        commonly used type of still in the production of bourbon and other American whiskeys. Column stills behave like
        a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. Whereas a single pot still charged with wine
        might yield a vapour enriched to 40–60% alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapour alcohol content of 95.6%;
        an azeotropic mixture of alcohol and water.</p>

    <h4>Aging</h4>
    <img class="paragraph-img" src="assets/images/1280px-Oak_Barrel.png">
    <p>Whiskies do not mature in the bottle, only in the cask, so the "age" of a whisky is only the time between
        distillation and bottling. This reflects how much the cask has interacted with the whisky, changing its
        chemical makeup and taste. Whiskies that have been bottled for many years may have a rarity value, but are
        not "older" and not necessarily "better" than a more recent whisky that matured in wood for a similar time.
        After a decade or two, additional aging in a barrel does not necessarily improve a whisky. While aging in
        wooden casks, especially American oak and French oak casks, whisky undergoes six processes that contribute
        to its final flavor: extraction, evaporation, oxidation, concentration, filtration, and colouration.
        Extraction in particular results in whisky acquiring a number of compounds, including aldehydes and acids
        such as vanillin, vanillic acid, and syringaldehyde. Distillers will sometimes age their whiskey in
        barrels previously used to age other spirits, such as rum or sherry, to impart particular flavours.</p>

    <h4>Packaging</h4>
    <p>Most whiskies are sold at or near an alcoholic strength of 40% abv, which is the statutory minimum in some
        countries – although the strength can vary, and cask-strength whisky may have as much as twice that alcohol
        percentage.</p>

    <h4>Exports</h4>
    <img class="paragraph-img" src="assets/images/1280px-CanadianWhisky.JPG">
    <p>Whisky is probably the best known of Scotland's manufactured products. Exports have increased by 87% in the
        decade to 2012 and it contributes over £4.25 billion to the UK economy, making up a quarter of all its food
        and drink revenues. In 2012, the US was the largest market for Scotch whisky (£655 million), followed by
        France (£535 million). It is also one of the UK's overall top five manufacturing export earners and it
        supports around 35,000 jobs. Principal whisky producing areas include Speyside and the Isle of Islay,
        where there are eight distilleries providing a major source of employment. In many places, the industry is
        closely linked to tourism, with many distilleries also functioning as attractions worth £30 million GVA each
        year. In 2011, 70% of Canadian whisky was exported, with about 60% going to the US, and the rest mostly to
        Europe and Asia. 15 million cases of Canadian whisky were sold in the US in 2011.</p>
